# hw 4

Broke up work into a few branches. 

    - I took code from my hw3 and added it here. 

    - Second branch I had the code somewhat working but my faker wasn't doing the number of tests based on num_records = 100

    - This branch I got it working with num_records and had the main.py execution for the calculator working properly based on user input.
        -  I also fixed all pylint errors so both faker and pylint were 100% successful.
